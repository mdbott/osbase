# The clientlaunch.cfg file is loaded by "xymonlaunch".
# It controls which of the Xymon client-side modules to run,
# (both the main client "xymonclient.sh" and any client-side
# extensions); how often, and with which parameters, options
# and environment variables.
#
# Note: On the Xymon *server* itself, this file is normally
#       NOT used. Instead, both the client- and server-tasks
#       are controlled by the hobbitlaunch.cfg file.
#

# msgcache is used for passive clients, that cannot connect
# directly to the Xymon server. This is not the default
# setup, so this task is normally disabled.
