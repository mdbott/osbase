# Configure the Hobbit client settings.

# You MUST set the list of Hobbit servers that this
# client reports to.
# It is good to use IP-adresses here instead of DNS
# names - DNS might not work if there's a problem.
#
# The defaults usually suffice for the rest of this file,
# but you can tweak the hostname that the client reports
# data with, and the OS name used (typically needed only on
# RHEL or RHAS servers).

# CLIENTHOSTNAME=""
# CLIENTOS="rhel3"

# Environment settings for the Hobbit client.

# BBDISP The IP-address used to contact the Xymon server. Default: Chosen when the Xymon client was compiled.
BBDISP="<%= @hobbitserver %>"

# BBDISPLAYS List of IP-adresses of Xymon servers. Data will be sent to all of the servers listed here. This setting is only used if BBDISP=0.0.0.0.
BBDISPLAYS=""                   # IP of multiple Hobbit servers. BBDISP must be "0.0.0.0".

CONFIGCLASS="$BBOSTYPE"         # Default configuration class for logfiles

PATH="/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/etc"  # PATH setting for the client scripts.

# You normally dont need to modify anything below here
BBPORT="1984"                   # Portnumber where hobbitd listens
BBHOME="$HOBBITCLIENTHOME"      # Directory for the Hobbit client files
BB="$BBHOME/bin/bb"             # The Hobbit client "bb" utility
BBTMP="$BBHOME/tmp"             # Where we may store temporary files.
BBCLIENTLOGS="$BBHOME/logs"     # Where we store the client logfiles


# The following defines a bunch of commands that BB extensions expect to be present.
# Hobbit does not use them, but they are provided here so if you use BB extension
# scripts, then they will hopefully run without having to do a lot of tweaking.
