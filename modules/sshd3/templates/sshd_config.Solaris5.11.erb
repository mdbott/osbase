# Configuration file for sshd(1m) (see also sshd_config(4))
#

#
# The sshd shipped in this release of Solaris supports SSH protocol 2 only so
# there is no need to set the Protocol option.
#

# Listen port (the IANA registered port number for ssh is 22)
Port 22

# The default listen address is all interfaces, this may need to be changed
# if you wish to restrict the interfaces sshd listens on for a multi homed host.
# Multiple ListenAddress entries are allowed.

# IPv4 only
#ListenAddress 0.0.0.0
# IPv4 & IPv6
ListenAddress ::

# Port forwarding
AllowTcpForwarding <%= @sshtcpforward %>

# If port forwarding is enabled, specify if the server can bind to INADDR_ANY.
# This allows the local port forwarding to work when connections are received
# from any remote host.
GatewayPorts no

# X11 tunneling options
X11Forwarding <%= @sshx11forward %>
X11DisplayOffset 10
X11UseLocalhost yes

# The maximum number of concurrent unauthenticated connections to sshd.
# start:rate:full see sshd(1) for more information.
# The default is 10 unauthenticated clients.
#MaxStartups 10:30:60

# Banner to be printed before authentication starts.
Banner /etc/issue

# Should sshd print the /etc/motd file and check for mail.
# On Solaris it is assumed that the login shell will do these (eg /etc/profile).
PrintMotd no

# KeepAlive specifies whether keep alive messages are sent to the client.
# See sshd(1) for detailed description of what this means.
# Note that the client may also be sending keep alive messages to the server.
KeepAlive yes
ClientAliveInterval 120

# Syslog facility and level

# Host private key files
# Must be on a local disk and readable only by the root user (root:sys 600).

# Default Encryption algorithms and Message Authentication codes
#Ciphers  aes128-ctr,aes128-cbc,arcfour,3des-cbc,blowfish-cbc
#MACS hmac-md5,hmac-sha1,hmac-sha1-96,hmac-md5-96

# Length of the server key
# Default 768, Minimum 512
ServerKeyBits 1024

# sshd regenerates the key every KeyRegenerationInterval seconds.
# The key is never stored anywhere except the memory of sshd.
# The default is 1 hour (3600 seconds).
KeyRegenerationInterval 3600

# Ensure secure permissions on users .ssh directory.
StrictModes yes

# Length of time in seconds before a client that hasn't completed
# authentication is disconnected.
# Default is 600 seconds. 0 means no time limit.
LoginGraceTime 60

# Maximum number of retries for authentication
# Default is 6. Default (if unset) for MaxAuthTriesLog is MaxAuthTries / 2
MaxAuthTries	6
MaxAuthTriesLog	3

# Are logins to accounts with empty passwords allowed.
# If PermitEmptyPasswords is no, pass PAM_DISALLOW_NULL_AUTHTOK 
# to pam_authenticate(3PAM).
PermitEmptyPasswords no

# To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change PasswordAuthentication to no.
PasswordAuthentication yes

# Are root logins permitted using sshd.
# Note that sshd uses pam_authenticate(3PAM) so the root (or any other) user
# maybe denied access by a PAM module regardless of this setting.
# Valid options are yes, without-password, no.
